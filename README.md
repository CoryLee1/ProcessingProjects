## Projects

Orbits on Orbits - base project for other orbit-themed projects. Honestly a mess. Video: none. 

Wonky Orbits - circles circling circles with the center circle circling the path created by something like r = cos(.5 * theta). Video: https://youtu.be/K9ZYQq7PilY

More Wonky Orbits - same as Wonky Orbits but with all of the circles circling with the path created by something like r = cos(0.5 * theta). Video: https://youtu.be/BJSpUPocrBo 

Too Many Orbits - same as Wonky Orbits but with more circles orbiting each circle. Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZxNnHlHOU and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koUqfKm1EHA (with tracing enabled)

Laser Pointer (16000) - a terminating line (16000 mini-segments) that reflects off the walls starting from the center. Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiLxZkUr6dA 

Random Connnect The Dots - a given number of dots are generated and then they are connected to their neighbors. Image generation concept for future videos.
