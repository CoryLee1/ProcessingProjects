## Projects

Orbits on Orbits - base project for other orbit-themed projects. Honestly a mess. Video: none. 

Wonky Orbits - circles circling circles with the center circle circling the path created by something like r = cos(.5 * theta). Video: https://youtu.be/K9ZYQq7PilY

More Wonky Orbits - same as Wonky Orbits but with all of the circles circling with the path created by something like r = cos(0.5 * theta). Video: https://youtu.be/BJSpUPocrBo 

Too Many Orbits - same as Wonky Orbits but with more circles orbiting each circle. Video: https://youtu.be/YoZxNnHlHOU and https://youtu.be/koUqfKm1EHA (with tracing enabled)

Laser Pointer (16000) - a terminating line (16000 mini-segments) that reflects off the walls starting from the center. Video: https://youtu.be/jiLxZkUr6dA

Random Connnect The Dots - a given number of dots are generated and then they are connected to their neighbors. Image generation concept for future videos.

rCTDDrift - a collection of very similar projects (all built on the Random Connect The Dots Project): 
* Dots Out of Center (video: https://youtu.be/MqKs8q3ZJv8 and https://youtu.be/okDCCyCUHP0)
* Connect The Dots Wisp (video: https://youtu.be/MvPGh1PcVJU)
* Drifting Connect The Dots (video: https://youtu.be/uCk78jwzZOs)
* Drifting To The Sides (video: https://youtu.be/NgFVnrh4aJc)
* Middle Line (Fast) (video: https://youtu.be/r49vz-vzrAE and https://youtu.be/ZZR0Wgvguno)

CTD Drift From Center - variant of the Random Connect The Dots project - recycling version of Dots Out of Center. Video: https://youtu.be/P6eO3NCH-6U

Spreading Pixels - randomly generated grid of colors, every frame it randomly selects 5 boxes that have different colors ajacent to them and expands their color to the 4 boxes on each side (no diagonal). Video: https://youtu.be/1FTefi0TnVY 

Dancing Islands - Spreading Pixels but with too many pixels for any to win and only two colors green (the islands) and blue (the ocean). Video: https://youtu.be/jHJoBTvOhfI

Conquering Pixels (Pulsing Colors) - randomly spreads pixels out in a solid color and then expands them using the spreading pixel method until they cover the screen, then it randomly spreads another color and repeats. (Also the blue/red is an example of chromostereopsis - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromostereopsis). Video: https://youtu.be/7ugP48Gb2-c

Lissajous Curve - basic project is a lissajous curve (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissajous_curve) with the parametric --> x = A * sin(a*t+c) y = B * sin(b*t) (t = i) increasing the 'c' value. 
* Lissajous Curve 1 manipulates the other variables as well. Videos: https://youtu.be/8zjWcnMuFd0 and https://youtu.be/Y7pMGQIZLps

Agario - dots that wander and combine. Unfinished

Image Manipulation - folder to practice image manipulation. Unfinished

Star Trails - Animation imitating the style produced when photos are taken of stars throughout the night using long exposures, rotating forever. Video: https://youtu.be/_aBD7zjS9sc 

Circles and Rings - Circles are placed in random locations and rings are drawn around them until a ring will overlap another circle's ring or go off the screen. 
* Circles and Rings Oscillating - instead of stopping when a ring overlaps or goes out of bound, the rings contract until the circle/ring is gone.
